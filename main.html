<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

<p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, making them faster and more scalable.</p>

<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. It is usually expressed in terms of O(n), where n is the input size. Managing Space Complexity is crucial for optimizing the memory usage of a program.</p>
