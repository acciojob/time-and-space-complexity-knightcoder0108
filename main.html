    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of efficient amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. Efficient algorithms are designed to run with the least amount of time possible, making them more scalable.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) uses memory that grows linearly with the input size.</p>
